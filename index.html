			Thanks for visiting my website! I recently graduated from UC Davis with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Technology Management. My goal is to obtain an entry-level/junior developer posiition. Currently, I am employed by Syntel as a Programmer Analyst consultant (QA Automation Engineer) for Wells Fargo. My prior experience includes an internship at the Sacramento County Department of Technology and a university position as an IT consultant for the UC Davis Computer Lab Management Department.
		</p>
			My hometown and current location is San Francisco, California. I first picked up programming in my AP Java class at Lowell High School and since then, I have been hooked. I am a jack of many trades: back-end, web development, mobile development, and databases, but hope to become a master of at least one someday. Please check my resume for more details.

			Outside of programming, I try to be as active as possible through tennis and weightlifting. My parents started me on tennis when I was eight, and I played for my high school varsity team. My passion for innovation extends to automobiles; my current steed is a 1994 Mazda Miata that I enjoy maintaining myself.
